    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>I am William Vasquez, an 11th grader taking IB classes for the college credits and the challenge. During my free time, I play video games, draw, and play guitar. I want to have a job in computer science. To achieve this goal, I have applied myself to CodeNation and AllStarCode. Where I am or have learned how to code and necessary business skills to succeed in computer science. I mostly want to be a data analyst and at the end of my career be a senior data engineer. I want to also get better at guitar and art, but I'm slowly getting better. It's not my main focus, but I do enjoy the end results/ creativity. I also love to</p>
